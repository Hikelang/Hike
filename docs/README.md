# Hike

**Welcome to the Hike language documentation!**

Just in case you have just stumbled upon this website, and have no idea what _Hike_ is, here's a brief introduction for you:
**Hike** - is an experimental language, that was created to be very fast and easy at the same time.

If you have not worked with a programming language before, this might be a bit difficult to get into, so it is not recommended to learn this programming language as first in your experience.

```hike
module main;

pub main() {
  print("hello world");
}
```
