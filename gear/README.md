<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hike is a programming language designed to simply solve problems in the fields of Data Science and Web Development. The language is currently in active development.

Pluses of the language:

- C-like syntax that is easy to get used to
- The concepts of the language are not much different from the concepts of others, which makes learning easier for those who are already programming
- Supports translation into other programming languages, into the bytecode of your own virtual machine and into a binary (Windows, Linux, Mac OS).

 The language is experimental and does not promise to be thoughtful.
